## Web3 Starter App

Using `vite, wagmi, linaria, ethers, zustand`

**Wagmi** + **ethers** take care of the most of boilerplate when it comes to blockchain connection + interaction. Plus **wagmi** already includes **react-query**.

**Linaria** strijes the balance between static CSS optimizations and CSS-in-JS conveniences.
**Zustand** is a small and easy state management library to setup.
